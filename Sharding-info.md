Want to make Ethereum faster and more mainstream? I'm planning to do so. For me to do:
- [x] Read the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
- [x] Read about the [stateless client concept](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172)
- [x] Familiarize with the Python sharding repo [here](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/tree/develop/sharding)
- [x] learn about abstract programming language features;
- [ ] WIP: [learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition);
- [ ] Maybe further familiarize with the sharding implementation on top of PyEVM [here](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding)
- [ ] Familiarize with Parity
- [ ] Start building stateless sharding and Ethereum 2.0 in this repo.
