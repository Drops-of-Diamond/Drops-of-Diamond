Want to make Ethereum faster and more mainstream? I'm planning to do so. For me to do:
- [x] read the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf);
- [x] read about the [stateless client concept](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172);
- [x] familiarize with the Python sharding repo [here](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/tree/develop/sharding);
- [x] learn about abstract programming language features;
- [ ] WIP: [learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition);
- [ ] maybe further familiarize with the sharding implementation on top of PyEVM [here](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding);
- [ ] familiarize with Parity; and
- [ ] start building stateless sharding and Ethereum 2.0 in this repo.

At the moment I'm working pro-bono, living off my savings. Once funds are raised or a grant is given by the Ethereum Foundation I can pay other developers.
